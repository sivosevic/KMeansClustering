# KMeansClustering

Purpose of this project was to establish an ideal location to start a gym business in Manhattan. Real datasets including NYC census, NYPD arrest, and Foursquare API were collected to evaluate Manhattan neighborhoods based on income, crime rate, and nearby competition. K-Means clustering was used to cluster neighborhoods and the Folium map to visualize them on a map of Manhattan. After analyzing each cluster, we were able to solve a business problem and find what area would be an optimal location to open a gym.
